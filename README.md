# anthem
A cutsom beamer theme with a sober and modern design based on simple geometric shapes.
Currently there is only one color theme (based on a dark blue),but more color themes are planned.

There is a special section mechanism to declare unnumbered section that have their own custom section page.

I make no restriction whatsoever on the output produced with the templates and only wish to apply the license to modified versions of the TeX template files.

This bundle consists of the following files:

beamerthemeanthem.sty

beamerinnerthemeanthem.sty

beamerouterthemeanthem.sty

beamercolorthemeanthem.sty
