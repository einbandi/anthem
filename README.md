# anthem
A custom beamer theme with a sober and modern design based on simple geometric shapes.
Currently there is only one color theme (based on a dark blue), but more color themes are planned.

There is a special section mechanism to declare unnumbered section that have their own custom section page (and are bookmarked in the PDF). Section title figures can be placed on all section title pages.

A new fancyblock is provided as an alternative to beamer's block environment.

An example showing the section figure and special section mechanisms as well as the fancyblock environment is part of the bundle.

I make no restriction whatsoever on the output produced with the templates and only wish to apply the license to modified versions of the TeX template files.

This bundle consists of the following files:

beamerthemeanthem.sty, beamerinnerthemeanthem.sty, beamerouterthemeanthem.sty, beamercolorthemeanthem.sty

anthem-example.tex, anthem-example.pdf
